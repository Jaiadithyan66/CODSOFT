# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning projects aimed at solving different problems using data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.

Projects Overview
Movie Genre Classification

This project predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
It involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms to classify movies into genres like Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.
Spam SMS Detection

The goal of this project is to detect whether an SMS message is spam or legitimate (ham).
It utilizes text mining, feature engineering, and supervised learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify SMS messages accurately.
Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent financial losses.
It employs machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting on transaction data to identify anomalous patterns indicative of fraud.
