## Projects Overview

## Movie Genre Classification

This project predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
It involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms to classify movies into genres like Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.
